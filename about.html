                  <span class="subtitle">360's Beginnings</span>
                  <p>360 was founded by Anna Edmonds when she was 17-years-old, a driven high school student at the time. Previously unaware of the Syrian Crisis, she was shaken awake by a powerful documentary that told the story of those who were being affected. From the moment the film ended, she knew her purpose was to do something to alleviate the pain of the less fortunate. The contrast of her own experience as an immigrant, along with the experiences and trials faced by those fleeing the war struck her deeply. She imagined herself in the shoes of a refugee; fleeing from her home and community out of fear of death, only to discover the horrific conditions of refugee camps. This drive is what spurred her into action. Anna realized that there were already incredibly reputable organizations doing similar work, and so she chose to combine her efforts with It Takes a Village to support two Syrian refugee families. </p>

                    <p>We are dedicated to changing the lives of those who have experienced the devastating Syrian war. In partnership with It Takes a Village, we fundraise in order increase the quality of life in Syrian Refugee camps and sponsor two families from Syria to immigrate to Canada. Our goal is to create a positive impact on the lives of those who are most vulnerable and in need of the world's help.  It is our responsibility as citizens of the world to intervene when there is injustice, and speak up when people are silenced by the deafening sounds of war. Those who are forced from their homes and become refugees do not have the privilege of choice, but we do. Our mission is to give lives a 360 degrees change, to empower the global community to help us with our goal, and enlighten people's perspectives by 360 degrees to one of the greatest issues of our generation. Making a difference is possible with your help. </p>
